A QA skills practice repository for testing the [TodoMVC TypeScript React app](https://todomvc.com/examples/typescript-react) using Playwright. The focus is on learning test automation, CI/CD quality gates, and best practices for maintainable test code.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Functional, accessibility, performance, and edge case testing
- **CI/CD quality gates**: Automated linting, formatting, security scanning, and code quality analysis
- **Best practices**: DRY principles, helper functions, web-first assertions, and proper test organization

## Test Suite

- **30+ Playwright tests** organized by priority and type:
  - `todomvc_high_priority.spec.ts` - Critical user flows (add, delete, complete, filter)
  - `todomvc_accessibility.spec.ts` - ARIA snapshots and keyboard navigation
  - `todomvc_performance.spec.ts` - Page load metrics and responsiveness with 100+ tasks
  - `todomvc_edge_cases.spec.ts` - Edit functionality and input validation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test
# or
npx playwright test

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed
# or
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test todomvc_high_priority

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
# or
npx playwright test --debug

# View test report
npm run report
# or
npx playwright show-report
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Quick check before committing (recommended)
npm run check

# Auto-fix all issues
npm run fix

# Individual commands:
# Format code
npm run format
# or
npx prettier --write .

# Check formatting only
npm run format:check
# or
npx prettier --check .

# Lint code
npm run lint
# or
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.js --plugin playwright

# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix
# or
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.js --plugin playwright --fix
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

All workflows depend on a centralized lint/format check:

1. **Code Quality Gate** (`lint.yml`) - Runs Prettier and ESLint
2. **Playwright Tests** (`playwright.yml`) - Runs all tests on Chromium
3. **CodeQL Security Analysis** (`codeql.yml`) - Scans for security vulnerabilities
4. **SonarCloud Quality Analysis** (`sonarcloud.yml`) - Analyzes code quality and technical debt

## Configuration

### Playwright Config

- **Base URL**: `https://todomvc.com`
- **Test Path**: `/examples/typescript-react/#/`
- **Browsers**: Chromium only in CI (for speed)
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled with 3 workers
- **Retries**: 2 in CI, 0 locally

### Code Quality Tools

- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **ESLint**: Linting with Playwright plugin
- **CodeQL**: Security analysis
- **SonarCloud**: Code quality and coverage analysis

## Learning Resources

- [QA Practice Plan](qa_practice_plan.md) - Step-by-step learning guide
- [Test Plan](todomvc_react_test_plan.md) - Test scenarios and priorities
- [Bug Register](bug_register.md) - Known issues and workarounds
- [Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md) - AI agent guidelines

## Future Enhancements

- **BrowserStack Integration**: Cross-browser testing with BrowserStack Automate
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Percy or Applitools integration
- **API Testing**: Backend API testing with Playwright
- **Mobile Testing**: iOS and Android app testing

## Contributing

This is a learning project, but contributions are welcome! Please:

1. Follow the existing code style (Prettier + ESLint)
2. Write tests using the established patterns (helper functions, test.step())
3. Update documentation as needed
