A QA skills practice repository for testing the [TodoMVC TypeScript React app](https://todomvc.com/examples/typescript-react) using Playwright. The focus is on learning test automation, CI/CD quality gates, and best practices for maintainable test code.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Functional, accessibility, performance, and edge case testing
- **CI/CD quality gates**: Automated linting, formatting, security scanning, and code quality analysis
- **Best practices**: DRY principles, helper functions, web-first assertions, and proper test organization

## Test Suite

- **30+ Playwright tests** organized by priority and type:
  - `todomvc_high_priority.spec.ts` - Critical user flows (add, delete, complete, filter)
  - `todomvc_accessibility.spec.ts` - ARIA snapshots and keyboard navigation
  - `todomvc_performance.spec.ts` - Page load metrics and responsiveness with 100+ tasks
  - `todomvc_edge_cases.spec.ts` - Edit functionality and input validation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test
# or
npx playwright test

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed
# or
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test todomvc_high_priority

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
# or
npx playwright test --debug

# View test report
npm run report
# or
npx playwright show-report

# Analyze test performance
npm run analyze
# or
node analyze-test-performance.js

# Run tests and analyze performance
npm run test:analyze
```

### Test Performance Analytics

The project includes a custom performance analysis tool that identifies slow tests:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

**Output includes:**

- ‚úÖ Total tests passed/failed
- ‚è±Ô∏è Total and average test duration
- üêå Slowest tests (> 5 seconds) - helps identify optimization targets
- ‚ö° Fastest tests (< 1 second)
- üìÇ Performance breakdown by test file

**Example:**

```
üêå SLOWEST TESTS (> 5 seconds):
1. [8.76s] Mark all tasks as completed
2. [8.70s] Space key to toggle checkbox
3. [8.48s] Responsiveness with 100+ tasks
```

This helps track test suite health and identify tests that need optimization.

### Code Quality

```bash
# Quick check before committing (recommended)
npm run check

# Auto-fix all issues
npm run fix

# Individual commands:
# Format code
npm run format
# or
npx prettier --write .

# Check formatting only
npm run format:check
# or
npx prettier --check .

# Lint code
npm run lint
# or
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.js --plugin playwright

# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix
# or
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.js --plugin playwright --fix
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

All workflows depend on a centralized lint/format check:

1. **Code Quality Gate** (`lint.yml`) - Runs Prettier and ESLint
2. **Playwright Tests** (`playwright.yml`) - Runs all tests on Chromium
3. **CodeQL Security Analysis** (`codeql.yml`) - Scans for security vulnerabilities
4. **SonarCloud Quality Analysis** (`sonarcloud.yml`) - Analyzes code quality and technical debt

## BrowserStack Integration (Optional)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice:** Never commit BrowserStack credentials to git!

For BrowserStack setup instructions, see: [BROWSERSTACK_SETUP.md](BROWSERSTACK_SETUP.md)

**Quick Setup:**

```bash
# Set environment variables (Linux/Mac/Git Bash)
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=your_username
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key

# Or create .env file (automatically ignored by git)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```
