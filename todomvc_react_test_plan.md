# Test Plan for TodoMVC React Example

## **1. Introduction**
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the TodoMVC React example located at `https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist`. The goal is to ensure the application functions as expected, covering both functional and non-functional aspects.

---

## **2. Scope**
The scope of this test plan includes:
- Functional testing of core features (e.g., adding, editing, deleting tasks).
- Non-functional testing (e.g., performance, accessibility).
- Cross-browser compatibility testing.

---

## **3. Test Objectives**
- Verify that users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Ensure tasks persist across page reloads.
- Validate filtering functionality (All, Active, Completed).
- Test edge cases (e.g., empty input, long task names).
- Check for accessibility compliance.
