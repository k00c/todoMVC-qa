# High-Level QA Skills Practice Plan

## **Hour 1: Planning and Test Strategy**

### 1. **Choose a Target Application**

- [x] Use a simple web app like [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) or any app you have access to.

### 2. **Define Test Scenarios**

- [x] Identify key features to test (e.g., adding, editing, deleting tasks).
- [x] Write down high-level test cases for both functional and non-functional testing (e.g., performance, accessibility).

### 3. **Prioritize Tests**

- [x] Use a risk-based approach to prioritize tests (e.g., critical user flows first).

### 4. **Plan Automation**

- [x] Decide which tests to automate (e.g., smoke tests, regression tests):
  - [ ] Automate high-priority tests for critical user flows (e.g., adding, editing, deleting tasks, filtering tasks).
  - [ ] Automate repetitive tests like smoke and regression tests.
  - [ ] Automate edge cases (e.g., special characters, long task names, empty inputs).
  - [ ] Automate non-functional tests (e.g., performance, accessibility).
- [ ] Outline the structure of your test scripts (e.g., folder structure, naming conventions).

## **Hour 2: Setting Up Playwright**

### 1. **Set Up Playwright**

- [x] If not already installed, set up Playwright in your project:
  ```bash
  npm init playwright@latest
  ```
- [x] Configure the project for TypeScript if needed.

### 2. **Create a Test Skeleton**

- [x] Write a basic test file for one feature (e.g., `add-todo.spec.ts`).
- [x] Use Playwright’s `test.describe` and `test.step` to structure your tests.

### 3. **Focus on Locators**

- [x] Practice using robust locators like `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, and `getByText`.

---

## **Hour 3: Automating Tests**

### 1. **Automate Key Scenarios**

- [x] Automate high-priority test cases from your plan.
- [x] Use Playwright’s auto-waiting and web-first assertions for reliability.

### 2. **Incorporate Accessibility Testing**

- [x] Use `toMatchAriaSnapshot` to validate accessibility tree structures.

### 3. **Add Assertions**

- [x] Ensure meaningful assertions (e.g., `toHaveText`, `toHaveURL`).

### 4. **Run and Debug**

- [x] Run your tests using:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```
- [x] Debug any failures and refine your scripts.

---

## **Hour 4: Advanced QA Skills**

### 1. **Explore Non-Functional Testing**

- [ ] Use Playwright’s tracing feature to analyze performance:
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
  ```

### 2. **Write a Test Report**

- [ ] Document your findings, including test results and any bugs discovered.

### 3. **Refactor and Optimize**

- [ ] Refactor your test scripts for readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Add comments to explain complex logic.

### 4. **Learn Something New**

- [ ] Explore Playwright’s advanced features like API testing or mobile emulation.

---

## **CI/CD Integration and Quality Assurance**

### 1. **Integrate with CI/CD**

- [x] Add static analysis and code quality tools (e.g., CodeQL, SonarCloud) to CI for enhanced code safety and quality.
- [ ] Do a dedicated "Quality Gate Review" to ensure all checks are useful, relevant and are efficient.
